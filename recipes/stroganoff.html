                <li> Saut√© ground beef in a large skillet over 
                     medium heat until browned and crumbly; 
                     5 to 10 minutes. </li>
                
                <li> At the same time, fill a large pot with 
                     lightly salted water and bring to a rapid 
                     boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until 
                     tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. 
                     Drain and set aside. </li>
                
                <li> Drain and discard any fat from the cooked 
                     beef. Stir condensed soup and garlic powder 
                     into the beef. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
                     occasionally. </li>
                
                <li> Remove beef from the heat. Add egg noodles 
                     and stir to combine. Stir in sour cream and 
                     season with salt and pepper. </li>
                
                <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
